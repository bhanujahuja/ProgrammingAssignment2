## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your
## functions do
## makeCacheMatrix function creates a "matrix" object that can cache its inverse,
## then returns the same through get function, 
## the matrix object can cache its own object,

## Write a short comment describing this function

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) { ## defining the argument with default "matrix"

}


## Write a short comment describing this function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
